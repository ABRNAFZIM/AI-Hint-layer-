# AI Scaffolding Hint Layer for Coding Education

## Overview
This repository documents the design and early prototype work for an AI-powered
**Hint Layer** that provides structured, progressive scaffolding for students
learning to code. Unlike traditional AI tutors that provide direct answers, this
system is designed to promote **critical thinking**, **academic integrity**, and
**mastery-based learning**.

The Hint Layer integrates:
- Static analysis of student code  
- Error classification  
- Context-aware prompt construction  
- Multi-level progressive hinting  
- Guardrails to prevent over-helping  
- Pedagogically grounded scaffolding (ZPD, mastery learning)

This work represents an original contribution to the field of AI-driven
education technology and demonstrates a novel approach to responsible AI in
learning environments.

## Key Features
- **Real-time misconception detection**  
  Identifies syntax, logic, and conceptual errors before generating hints.

- **Progressive Hinting Engine**  
  Four levels of scaffolding:  
  1. Metacognitive nudge  
  2. Conceptual guidance  
  3. Specific technical hint  
  4. Worked example (non-solution)

- **Static Analysis + LLM Hybrid Pipeline**  
  Ensures accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and maintains academic integrity.

- **Context-Aware Prompt Builder**  
  Generates structured prompts for LLMs based on task, code, and error type.

- **Editor Integration Ready**  
  Designed to plug into browser-based or desktop IDEs.
