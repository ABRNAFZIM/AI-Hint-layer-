# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of the AI Scaffolding Hint Layer. It is intentionally ambitious, reflecting the long‑term potential of responsible AI in education.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Current)

- High‑level architecture design
- Progressive hinting model (Levels 1–4)
- Frustration Detection Layer (v1)
- Mentor Escalation Engine (v1)
- Pseudocode prototypes
- Documentation and diagrams

---

## Phase 2 — Early Prototype

- Implement basic static analysis
- Integrate LLM prompt builder
- Build a minimal hint engine
- Add frustration scoring logic
- Create a mentor notification mock API
- Build example student scenarios

---

##  Phase 3 — Responsible AI Enhancements

- Improve frustration detection using:
  - keystroke patterns
  - time‑on‑task modelling
  - repeated error clustering
- Add emotional safety messages
- Add adaptive hint throttling
- Add academic integrity guardrails

---

##  Phase 4 — Functional Prototype

- Browser‑based demo editor
- Real‑time hint panel
- Mentor dashboard (mock)
- Logging and analytics layer
- User testing with sample tasks

---

## Phase 5 — Scaling & Integration

- LMS integration (Moodle, Canvas)
- VS Code extension prototype
- Multilingual hinting
- Curriculum‑aware scaffolding
- Personalised learning profiles

---

##  Phase 6 — Research & Publication

- Publish whitepaper on responsible AI scaffolding
- Release open‑source reference implementation
- Conduct pilot studies with educators
- Present findings at EdTech and AI conferences

---

This roadmap will evolve as the project grows. Contributions and collaboration are welcome.
